        <p id="tribute-info">If you’re not Mongolian, then you (probably) will not have heard of Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj.<br>Born in 1906, Natsagdorj was a Mongolian poet and writer. <br>He was also the founder of the Mongolian Writer’s Union and is considered one of the founding fathers of modern Mongolian  – one of the pioneers of modern Mongol literature.<br>He is the author of one of my favourite Mongolian poems – ‘Minii Nutag – My Home’ which celebrates the natural beauty of Mongolia. <br><br><img src="Natsagdorj_2.jpg" alt="Natsadorj sitting on chair" class="image_2"><br><br>For 70 years (1924-1990), Mongolia was a communist state with close alignment with the Soviet Union.  <br>The early writings of Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj during this communist period are considered an example of Mongolian “socialist realism.” <br>Mongolia’s literature – including the poems and writing of  Dashdorjiin Natsagdorj – is framed by the cycle of the seasons, by landscape and weather. <br>It is also influenced by Mongolia’s rich history, its traditional nomadic culture and is also shaped by the worshipping of Buddhism and Shamanism.</p>
